<objective>
Curate and fetch real coordinate data for 100 global trails covering all remaining weather API countries (JP, GB, FR, CH, IT, ZA, DE), deduplicated against US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand lists.

Purpose: Expand coverage beyond launch markets to all weather API countries. New Zealand is handled separately in Plan 10-04b, so this plan covers the remaining 7 countries. With NZ removed, the 15 former NZ slots are redistributed to strengthen coverage of underrepresented countries.

Output: Validated trail data JSON files for 100 global trails ready for integration.

1. Review the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand trail lists (from Plans 03/04/04b results) to know what's already covered. The global list must NOT include any trail already in those lists. In particular, NZ trails are now handled entirely by Plan 10-04b -- do NOT include any NZ trails here.

2. Create `scripts/trail-curation/trail-lists/global-trails.json` with 100 TrailInput entries distributed across 7 weather API countries (JP, GB, FR, CH, IT, ZA, DE). With NZ removed, the former ~15 NZ slots are redistributed to strengthen other countries. Aim for roughly 14-15 trails per country:

3. Split into batches of 50. Run batch 1:
   ```
   npx tsx scripts/trail-curation/batch-fetch.ts scripts/trail-curation/trail-lists/global-trails-batch1.json scripts/trail-curation/results/global-trails-batch1.json
   ```

4. Review results, retry failures with alternate search terms.
  </action>
  <verify>
Check batch 1 results: at least 40/50 successful. Verify NO New Zealand trails are present. Verify no trail names duplicate those in US/CA/AU/NZ lists. Print per-country breakdown.
  </verify>
  <done>
100 global trails curated in trail list covering 7 countries (JP, GB, FR, CH, IT, ZA, DE). First 50 fetched with at least 80% success rate. No NZ trails. No duplicates with US/CA/AU/NZ lists.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fetch global trails batch 2 (trails 51-100) and resolve failures</name>
  <files>
    scripts/trail-curation/results/global-trails-batch2.json
  </files>
  <action>
1. Run batch-fetch for trails 51-100:
   ```
   npx tsx scripts/trail-curation/batch-fetch.ts scripts/trail-curation/trail-lists/global-trails-batch2.json scripts/trail-curation/results/global-trails-batch2.json
   ```

2. Review all failures from both batches. For global trails, OSM coverage varies significantly:
   - European trails (FR, CH, IT, DE, GB): Excellent OSM coverage, expect high success
   - Japan: Good coverage for major trails, may need Japanese name search terms (e.g., "熊野古道" for Kumano Kodo)
   - South Africa: Variable coverage -- some major trails may not be in OSM. Check SANParks for any public trail data.

3. Retry failures:
   - Try native language names as searchName for JP trails
   - Try alternate trail name variations
   - For persistent failures, attempt way-based queries instead of relation-based

4. Target: at least 85/100 successful.

5. Run deduplication check across ALL result files (US, CA, AU, NZ, Global) using directory scanning:
   ```
   npx tsx scripts/trail-curation/deduplicate-trails.ts scripts/trail-curation/results/
   ```
   This scans all JSON files in the results directory and checks for cross-region duplicates.
   Resolve any cross-list duplicates by removing from the global list.
   IMPORTANT: Verify zero NZ trails appear in the global results.
  </action>
  <verify>
Count total successful global trails across both batches. At least 85/100. Run deduplication across ALL regions (including NZ) -- zero cross-region duplicates. Zero NZ trails present. Print per-country success counts.
  </verify>
  <done>
100 global trails fetched across 7 countries (JP, GB, FR, CH, IT, ZA, DE). At least 85 have real OSM data. Cross-region deduplication verified -- no trail appears in multiple lists. No NZ trails present. Per-country breakdown documented.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>
