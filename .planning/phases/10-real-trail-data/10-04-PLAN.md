<objective>
Curate and fetch real coordinate data for the top 50 Canadian and top 50 Australian (including 25 Tasmanian) hiking trails.

Purpose: Canada and Australia are launch markets alongside the US. This plan handles both markets in one pass since they have the same trail count (50 each, 100 total).

Output: Validated trail data JSON files for Canada (50 trails) and Australia (50 trails) ready for integration.

2. Run batch-fetch:
   ```
   npx tsx scripts/trail-curation/batch-fetch.ts scripts/trail-curation/trail-lists/australia-trails.json scripts/trail-curation/results/australia-trails.json
   ```

3. Review results. Tasmania OSM coverage may be spotty -- for Tasmanian trails that fail:
   - Try alternate search terms (many TAS trails use "track" not "trail")
   - Try searching for the specific park name + track name
   - Note: Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service publishes some trail data that may be available as open data

4. Retry failures. Target: at least 40/50 successful (at least 20/25 Tasmanian).
