<objective>
Curate and fetch real coordinate data for the top 25 Canadian and top 50 Australian (including 25 Tasmanian) hiking trails.

Purpose: Canada and Australia are launch markets alongside the US. This plan handles both smaller markets in one pass since they have fewer trails combined (75 total) than US alone (100).

Output: Validated trail data JSON files for Canada (25 trails) and Australia (50 trails) ready for integration.

   ```
   npx tsx scripts/trail-curation/batch-fetch.ts scripts/trail-curation/trail-lists/canada-trails.json scripts/trail-curation/results/canada-trails.json
   ```

3. Review and retry failures. Target: at least 20/25 successful.

4. For any trails not in OSM, check Parks Canada / provincial park websites for downloadable GPX or trail coordinates. Note these for manual entry if needed.

1. Create `scripts/trail-curation/trail-lists/australia-trails.json` with exactly 50 TrailInput entries. CRITICAL: exactly 25 must be in Tasmania (region: "Tasmania"). For each trail, provide: name, searchName (OSM name if different), region (state), country ("AU"), officialDistanceKm, typicalDays, bbox.

**THE COMPLETE 50 AUSTRALIAN TRAILS LIST:**

NOTE: Trail 50 is counted as mainland in this numbering but is technically TAS -- this gives us 26 TAS trails total (25 in the TAS section + trail 50), exceeding the 25 minimum requirement.

2. Run batch-fetch:
   ```
   npx tsx scripts/trail-curation/batch-fetch.ts scripts/trail-curation/trail-lists/australia-trails.json scripts/trail-curation/results/australia-trails.json
   ```

3. Review results. Tasmania OSM coverage may be spotty -- for Tasmanian trails that fail:
   - Try alternate search terms (many TAS trails use "track" not "trail")
   - Try searching for the specific park name + track name
   - Note: Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service publishes some trail data that may be available as open data

4. Retry failures. Target: at least 40/50 successful (at least 20/25 Tasmanian).
