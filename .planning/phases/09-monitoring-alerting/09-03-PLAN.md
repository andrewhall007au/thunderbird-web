<objective>
Wire existing Playwright E2E tests as synthetic monitors running against production on schedule, including login flow and SMS webhook synthetic tests.

Purpose: HTTP health checks (Plan 01) catch server-level issues but miss UI/JavaScript bugs like the BetaApplyModal production bug. Playwright synthetic tests catch real user-facing issues by exercising actual browser flows. Login and SMS webhook tests ensure authentication and core SMS pipeline remain functional.

Output: Synthetic test runner that executes existing E2E tests against production, stores results as metrics, and integrates with the scheduler. Covers all critical flows: beta signup, checkout, create-first, login, and SMS webhook.

**e2e/monitoring.config.ts** - Playwright config for monitoring runs:

Create a separate Playwright config specifically for monitoring (don't modify the existing playwright.config.ts used for development/CI). This config:
- `baseURL`: `process.env.MONITOR_BASE_URL || 'https://thunderbird.bot'` (always targets production)
- `timeout`: 120_000 (120 seconds - generous for production, per research guidance)
- `retries`: 0 (monitoring should report actual state, not retry away failures)
- `workers`: 1 (single worker to avoid parallel browser load)
- `reporter`: [['json', { outputFile: '/tmp/playwright-monitor-results.json' }]]
- `use.headless`: true
- `use.actionTimeout`: 30_000
- Projects: single project with chromium only (lightweight)

**backend/monitoring/checks_synthetic.py** - Synthetic test runner:

`run_playwright_check(test_file: str, test_name: str | None = None) -> CheckResult`:
- Runs a Playwright test against production using subprocess
- Command: `npx playwright test {test_file} --config=e2e/monitoring.config.ts --reporter=json`
- If `test_name` provided, add `--grep "{test_name}"` to run specific test
- Set environment variables:
  - `BASE_URL=https://thunderbird.bot` (or from config)
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `CI=true` (suppresses interactive prompts)
- Set working directory to project root (parent of backend/)
- Timeout: 180 seconds (subprocess timeout)
- Parse JSON output from stdout to extract:
  - Overall pass/fail status
  - Duration in milliseconds
  - Error message if failed (extract from `suites[0].specs[0].tests[0].results[0].error.message`)
- Return `CheckResult` with:
  - `check_name`: derived from test_file (e.g., "beta-signup-flow.spec.ts" -> "synthetic_beta_signup")
  - `status`: 'pass' or 'fail'
  - `duration_ms`: total test duration
  - `error_message`: extracted error or timeout message
  - `metadata`: {"test_file": test_file, "output_file": "/tmp/playwright-monitor-results.json"}

Handle edge cases:
- `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`: Return fail with "Test timed out after 180 seconds"
- `FileNotFoundError` (npx not found): Return fail with "Playwright not installed"
- JSON parse failure: Return fail with raw stderr output (first 500 chars)
- Any other exception: Return fail with exception message

Convenience functions for scheduled use:
- `check_beta_signup_synthetic() -> CheckResult`: Runs `beta-signup-flow.spec.ts`
- `check_buy_now_synthetic() -> CheckResult`: Runs `buy-now-flow.spec.ts`
- `check_create_first_synthetic() -> CheckResult`: Runs `create-first-flow.spec.ts`
- `check_login_synthetic() -> CheckResult`: Tests the login/authentication flow against production. If a dedicated `e2e/login-flow.spec.ts` exists, run it. Otherwise, create a lightweight HTTP-based login check: POST to `{PRODUCTION_URL}/api/auth/login` with a known test account (e.g., `monitor@thunderbird.bot` / test credentials from env var `MONITOR_TEST_PASSWORD`). Expect 200 with valid JWT token in response. Return CheckResult with check_name="synthetic_login". This tests authentication infrastructure every 10 minutes.
- `check_sms_webhook_synthetic() -> CheckResult`: Tests the SMS webhook handling pipeline. Send a POST to `{PRODUCTION_URL}/api/webhook/sms` (or the Twilio webhook endpoint) with a synthetic inbound SMS payload matching Twilio's webhook format (From: a test number from env var `MONITOR_TEST_PHONE`, Body: "PING"). Expect 200/204 response (webhook received and processed). Return CheckResult with check_name="synthetic_sms_webhook". This validates the entire SMS inbound pipeline daily. Use a clearly identifiable test phone number to avoid confusion with real user messages.

IMPORTANT: These synthetic checks should NOT create real data in production. The login check uses a dedicated monitoring account. The SMS webhook check uses a PING command that the webhook handler should recognize and handle gracefully (or at minimum, not crash on).

1. `python -c "from monitoring.checks_synthetic import run_playwright_check, check_beta_signup_synthetic, check_login_synthetic, check_sms_webhook_synthetic; print('Synthetic imports OK')"` from backend/ directory.
2. Verify monitoring.config.ts is valid: `npx playwright test --config=e2e/monitoring.config.ts --list` from project root (may show tests or config error - just verify it parses).
  </verify>
  <done>Playwright synthetic test runner wraps existing E2E tests, runs them against production URL with generous timeouts, parses JSON results into CheckResult format, handles all error cases gracefully. Login and SMS webhook synthetic checks are implemented for authentication and SMS pipeline monitoring.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Wire synthetic checks into scheduler including login and SMS webhook intervals</name>
  <files>
    backend/monitoring/scheduler.py
  </files>
  <action>
Update `backend/monitoring/scheduler.py` to add synthetic check jobs:

Add these scheduled jobs to `create_scheduler()`:

1. `synthetic_beta_signup` (every 5 minutes):
   - Calls `check_beta_signup_synthetic()`
   - This is the MOST critical synthetic check (catches bugs like the BetaApplyModal issue)
   - Classified as severity=critical in alert manager

2. `synthetic_checkout` (every 15 minutes):
   - Calls `check_buy_now_synthetic()`
   - Revenue-critical flow
   - Classified as severity=critical

3. `synthetic_create_first` (every 15 minutes):
   - Calls `check_create_first_synthetic()`
   - User experience flow
   - Classified as severity=warning

4. `synthetic_login` (every 10 minutes):
   - Calls `check_login_synthetic()`
   - Authentication infrastructure check
   - Classified as severity=warning (login issues need attention but email-first escalation is appropriate)
   - Interval: 10 minutes per MON-02 requirement

5. `synthetic_sms_webhook` (daily):
   - Calls `check_sms_webhook_synthetic()`
   - SMS pipeline integrity check
   - Classified as severity=critical (SMS is the core product)
   - Use IntervalTrigger(days=1) or CronTrigger(hour=6, minute=0) to run once daily at 6 AM UTC
   - Run immediately on first startup as well (`next_run_time=datetime.now()`)

Each synthetic job:
- Wraps the check call in try/except (synthetic failures should never crash scheduler)
- Calls `alert_manager.evaluate_and_alert(result)` after each check (if alert_manager is wired in from Plan 02; if Plan 02 not yet executed, just call `store_metric()` directly)
- Logs start and completion of each synthetic check with timing

Make the synthetic checks conditional: only add them if Playwright is available on the system (check for `npx` in PATH). If not available, log a warning and skip synthetic jobs. This allows the monitoring service to run in environments without Node.js installed (e.g., development) while still providing HTTP-based checks.

Exception: `check_login_synthetic` and `check_sms_webhook_synthetic` use HTTP requests (not Playwright browser), so they should ALWAYS be added regardless of Playwright availability. Only the Playwright-based browser tests (beta_signup, checkout, create_first) are conditional on npx.

```python
import shutil
PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE = shutil.which('npx') is not None

if PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE:
    # Add Playwright browser-based synthetic check jobs
    ...
else:
    logger.warning("npx not found - Playwright browser synthetic checks disabled")

# Always add HTTP-based synthetic checks (login, SMS webhook)
scheduler.add_job(check_login_synthetic, ...)
scheduler.add_job(check_sms_webhook_synthetic, ...)
```

1. `python -c "from monitoring.scheduler import create_scheduler; s = create_scheduler(); jobs = s.get_jobs(); print(f'{len(jobs)} jobs configured'); [print(f'  {j.id}: {j.trigger}') for j in jobs]"` from backend/ directory shows synthetic jobs listed including login (10min) and sms_webhook (daily).
2. Verify conditional behavior: Playwright browser jobs appear only if npx is available, but login and SMS webhook always appear.
  </verify>
  <done>Scheduler runs synthetic Playwright tests at configured intervals (beta signup every 5min, checkout every 15min, create-first every 15min). Login synthetic check runs every 10 minutes. SMS webhook synthetic check runs daily. HTTP-based checks (login, SMS webhook) always enabled. Playwright browser checks conditionally enabled based on npx availability. Results flow through the same metric storage and alert pipeline as HTTP checks.</done>
