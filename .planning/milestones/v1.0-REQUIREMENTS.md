# Requirements: Thunderbird Global

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Multi-tenant architecture | Using fork model for simpler evolution |
| Real-time GPS tracking | SMS only, not live location |
| Mobile app | Web-only for v1 |
| Countries beyond initial 8 | Expand after proving model |
| Subscription model | One-time purchase is core differentiator |
| Full route drawing tool | GPX upload handles 95% of cases |
| Turn-by-turn navigation | Not the product; link to dedicated apps |
| Social route sharing/comments | Community features expensive to moderate |
| Self-service affiliate signup | Quality control via admin approval |
| Multi-level marketing | Reputational and regulatory risk |
| Automatic affiliate payouts | Cash flow risk; manual review required |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| FOUN-01 to FOUN-05 | Phase 1 | Complete |

- Mapped to phases: 81
- Unmapped: 0

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 81 of 81 v1 requirements (100%)

**Adjusted during implementation:**
- Phase 6 (WTHR-06): Switzerland provider changed from MeteoSwiss to ICON-EU via Open-Meteo (MeteoSwiss endpoint doesn't exist)
- Phase 8: Implemented without formal PLAN files (security changes deployed directly)
- Phase 9: Added 3 additional requirements during implementation (MON-06: login testing, MON-07: log aggregation, MON-08: dashboard)

**Dropped:** None

**Technical debt carried forward:**
- International weather infrastructure built but not activated for SMS users (ready for future expansion)
- Monitoring dashboard authentication (internal tool, direct URL access only)
