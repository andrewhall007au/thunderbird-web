## Effective Cost Per Weather Forecast

### Garmin inReach

| Plan | Per-Forecast Cost | Calculation |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | $0.50 | Pay-as-you-go pricing |
| **Essential** | ~$0.30+ | $14.99 ÷ 50 messages (if only used for weather - realistic cost higher) |
| **Standard** | ~$0.20+ | $30 ÷ 150 messages (if only used for weather - realistic cost higher) |
| **Premium** | $0 | Unlimited (but $50/month base cost) |

**Reality Check:** Users need messages for other communication, so effective weather cost is higher than calculated rates on Essential/Standard plans.

### ZOLEO

| Plan | Per-Forecast Cost | Calculation |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Basic** | ~$0.27+ | $20 ÷ 75 messages (if only used for weather - realistic cost higher) |
| **In Touch** | ~$0.12+ | $35 ÷ 300 messages (if only used for weather - realistic cost higher) |
| **Unlimited** | $0 | Unlimited (but $50/month base cost) |

**Reality Check:** Same issue - messages needed for other uses inflate effective weather cost.

### Thunderbird

| Model | Per-Forecast Cost | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| **Prepaid Credits** | **$0.33** | $29.99 provides 90 forecasts. No monthly fee. No device cost. |
